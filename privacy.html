                We use personal information collected via our Website for a variety of
                business purposes described below. We process your personal information for
                these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order
                to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for
                compliance with our legal obligations. We indicate the specific processing
                grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below.

            <p>
                In legal terms, we are generally the "data controller" under European data
                protection laws since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data
                processing we perform. However, if you are a business customer with whom we
                have entered into a data processing agreement for the provision of
                corporate services to you, then you would be the "data controller" and we
                would be the "data processor" under European data protection laws since we
                would be processing data on your behalf in accordance with your
                instructions.

                standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
                As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of

                Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
                determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our
                system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
                information so that we can match it with information you have previously
                provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
                may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
                information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
                may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that
                you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification
                methods as the circumstances dictate.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
                your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we
                will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
                verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the
                information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
                additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for
                security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
                provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
